## Purpose and Scope

### Purpose
This Access Control Policy establishes requirements for managing user identities, authentication, and authorization within the 4Seasons Real Estate application environment. It ensures that only authorized individuals have appropriate access to systems, applications, and data.

### Objectives
- Implement least privilege access principles
- Ensure proper identity verification and authentication
- Maintain accurate records of user access
- Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive resources
- Support compliance with regulatory requirements

### Scope
This policy applies to:
- All 4Seasons application systems (production, staging, development)
- All users (employees, contractors, third parties, service accounts)
- All access types (interactive, programmatic, emergency)
- All data classifications (public, internal, sensitive, restricted)
- All environments (on-premises, cloud, hybrid)

---

## Access Control Principles

### Fundamental Principles

#### 1. Least Privilege
- Users granted minimum access necessary for job functions
- Default access is "deny" unless explicitly granted
- Regular review and reduction of excessive privileges
- Time-limited access for temporary needs

#### 2. Separation of Duties
- Critical functions require multiple individuals
- No single user has end-to-end control over sensitive processes
- Conflicting responsibilities distributed among different roles
- Independent verification of high-risk activities

#### 3. Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of access controls
- Authentication plus authorization requirements
- Network, application, and data-level controls
- Monitoring and logging at all levels

#### 4. Need to Know
- Access limited to information required for specific tasks
- Business justification required for data access
- Regular validation of continued need
- Automatic expiration of time-limited access

### Implementation Standards

#### Zero Trust Architecture
- Never trust, always verify
- Explicit verification for every transaction
- Assume breach mentality
- Continuous validation of access requests

#### Risk-Based Access
- Access controls based on risk assessment
- Higher security for sensitive resources
- Adaptive authentication based on context
- Dynamic authorization decisions
