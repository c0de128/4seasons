## 1. Purpose and Scope

### 1.1 Purpose
This policy establishes the framework for identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and remediating security vulnerabilities in the 4Seasons Real Estate application and infrastructure.

### 1.2 Scope
This policy applies to:
- All application components (frontend, backend, database)
- Third-party dependencies and libraries
- Infrastructure components (servers, networks, cloud services)
- Development and production environments
- All personnel involved in development, operations, and security

## 2. Vulnerability Management Framework

### 2.1 Vulnerability Categories
Vulnerabilities are classified by:
- **Source**: Application code, dependencies, infrastructure, configuration
- **Severity**: Critical, High, Medium, Low (based on CVSS v3.1)
- **Exploitability**: Remote, Local, Physical access required
- **Impact**: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability

### 2.2 Vulnerability Sources
- Automated security scanning tools
- Dependency vulnerability databases (npm audit, Snyk, GitHub Advisories)
- Security research and bug bounty programs
- Penetration testing results
- Code review findings
- Third-party security assessments

## 3. Vulnerability Assessment Process

### 3.1 Discovery and Identification
1. **Automated Scanning**:
   - Daily dependency vulnerability scans
   - Weekly application security scans
   - Continuous monitoring of security feeds

2. **Manual Assessment**:
   - Code reviews for security issues
   - Architecture security reviews
   - Penetration testing (quarterly)

### 3.2 Risk Assessment Criteria
Vulnerabilities are assessed based on:
- **CVSS Base Score**: Technical severity rating
- **Environmental Score**: Impact on our specific environment
- **Temporal Score**: Exploit code maturity and remediation level
- **Business Impact**: Effect on operations, revenue, reputation

### 3.3 Severity Classification

#### Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)
- Remote code execution vulnerabilities
- SQL injection with admin access
- Authentication bypass
- Complete system compromise

#### High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)
- Privilege escalation
- Significant data exposure
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) with admin context
- Denial of service with high impact

#### Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
- Information disclosure
- Limited privilege escalation
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- Input validation issues

#### Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)
- Minor information leakage
- Non-security impacting issues
- Theoretical vulnerabilities

## 4. Response and Remediation

### 4.1 Response Time Requirements

| Severity | Detection | Assessment | Remediation Plan | Implementation |
|----------|-----------|------------|------------------|----------------|
| Critical | 1 hour    | 4 hours    | 8 hours         | 24 hours      |
| High     | 4 hours   | 24 hours   | 3 days          | 7 days        |
| Medium   | 24 hours  | 3 days     | 14 days         | 30 days       |
| Low      | 72 hours  | 7 days     | 30 days         | 90 days       |

### 4.2 Remediation Options
1. **Patch/Update**: Apply vendor-provided fixes
2. **Workaround**: Implement temporary mitigations
3. **Configuration Change**: Modify settings to reduce risk
